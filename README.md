# My-Custom-Orm

For this project, I created a custom object-relational mapping service. This helps Java programmers send/view/edit/delete objects in databases without knowing much SQL.
The Java classes that the user wants to map should be POJOs.

Technology used include: Java, PostgreSQL, DBeaver, AWS. 

To use my ORM, simply clone the project, edit the properties file to fit your database needs, and convert to a jar file if you want to use it as a dependency in the future.
