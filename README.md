# My-Custom-Orm

For this project, I created a custom object-relational mapping service. This helps Java programmers send/view/edit/delete objects in databases without knowing much SQL.
The Java classes that the user wants to map should be POJOs.

Technology used include: Java, PostgreSQL, and DBeaver.
